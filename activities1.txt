1) difference btw http-http/2?
           HTTP-----> HYPERTEXT TRANSFER PROTOCOL

        what WE USE HTTP IS-->we use fetch the data over the internet.
        communication btw the server and clients exchange the message 
HTTP---> the frist usable version was created by 1997 this version still using

HTTP/2---> was created by 2015 and this is much faster than http
http/2 is comes under the prioritizes of the loading content


diff btw http,http/2

multiplexing---->http is loads resource one after other,if any one resource collapse
anthor all  recource will block
           ----->hhtp/2 is totally different ,it able to use single TCP connect to set 
           multiple stream of data at onces
sever push

this approach is not partical for modern web page
hhtp/2 sources the problem by allow the push content to a client before the client ask            

head comparison 

it small file loads both are same hhtp/2 is much advanced method by elminating a few bytes 
from every http pack
