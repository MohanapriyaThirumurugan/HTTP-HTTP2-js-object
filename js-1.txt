write about the object and its internal representation
 
 * object
 object is a collection pf properties and method is an association btw a name (key) and a value.
 
  realtime example object

 * object--> is a car    
 * properties are  like --->color,model,weight,price ,etc....   
 * method (is thing can do like) --> like stop,slow ,breake,fast etc....


 * internal representation
  let car{         // properties
    color:"black"
    weight:"700kg"
    price:700000
    buy(){             // for method
        console.log("to to the list")
    }


  }
console.log(car);  // how to acesses the value  
output is 
black
700kg
700000

console.log(car.weight); // how to acesses the single value
output is 
700kg

car.buy( )-------- method calll....


 * and we accesses like [] also
 for example
 let worker{
    work_exp:6 
 }
 console.log([work_exp]); if we use properties like two words we c an use [ ]..
